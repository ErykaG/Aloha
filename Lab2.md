Check 2: Why is it important to choose a license?

A license helps support the goal of your software project. If the desire is to make it "free software," a license can be used
to let people know they can do things like modify the available source code, and then (if desired) have them continue the trend
of keeping any released modifications to the software free also. Developers can pick and choose how restrictive they want to
be by choosing a license.
