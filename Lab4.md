Lab 4: FreeBSD Documentation

I changed the wording of one sentence in the developers handbook documentation.

"It is an excellent tool to work with when teaching programming in small ages, as it makes..."

Changed to:
"It is an excellent tool to work with when teaching programming to younger ages, as it makes..."

From this lab I have learned that documentation is important because it allows users to know what is going on,
and giving them the ability to contact the creators about errors is extremely beneficial. Even though I have never
looked at the documentation of anything before this, I can see how important it is for developers/creators and anyone who
uses the program/website/whatever it is.
