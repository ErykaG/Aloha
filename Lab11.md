#### Bonus Lab 11

1. Part 2 & 3 of foss2serve link: (screenshot of chat in folder) Summary: Downloaded ChatZilla and joined IRC channel labeled
ubuntu to observe how people interact. It is a help channel and flow of the conversations usually goes ~ question asked by a user
of ubuntu...short pause in time...more experienced user either answers in plain text or with a helpful link in the chat. Noticed that
"dumb" questions are politely handled and the questioner is not torn apart for asking. Example: "i need help with my ubunto 9.10
installing a wifi driver can anyone help me???" First answer: "nope, version is EOL, dead, upgrade please." Versus telling them to
go away or something similar. Rudeness does not seem to be tolerated as it is seen as a more professional site for asking for help
and receiving it almost immediately.

2. Observing Open Source Slack Channel for Intro to Open Source class:

Name: csci2961, Website: rcos.slack.com/messages/csci2961/, Description: Slack communication channel for Open Source Class Fall 2015, Project Goal: Provide a way to communicate various things to the class throughout the semester, Communication Modes: plan text, links github pages, links to various helpful articles or sites. Questions asked by students are answered by either the professor or one of the undergrad TAs.

Reflection on the Culture of the Community: The majority of the messages or posts in the channel are done by Moorthy (the professor), followed by the undergraduate TAs of the class. Students mostly use the channel to ask questions about the class or a topic they would like clarification on/more info on, then the question is answered in a timely manner by Moorthy or one of the TAs either in plain text or with a link to a related site. Most recently, it has been used to provide the entire class with access to the project slides of each group project worked on during this semester. There is very little to no messages that could be considered "spam" in this chat channel.
