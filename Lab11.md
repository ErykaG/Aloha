#### Bonus Lab 11

1. Part 2 & 3 of foss2serve link: (screenshot of chat in folder) Summary: Downloaded ChatZilla and joined IRC channel labeled
ubuntu to observe how people interact. It is a help channel and flow of the conversations usually goes ~ question asked by a user
of ubuntu...short pause in time...more experienced user either answers in plain text or with a helpful link in the chat. Noticed that
"dumb" questions are politely handled and the questioner is not torn apart for asking. Example: "i need help with my ubunto 9.10
installing a wifi driver can anyone help me???" First answer: "nope, version is EOL, dead, upgrade please." Versus telling them to
go away or something similar. Rudeness does not seem to be tolerated as it is seen as a more professional site for asking for help
and receiving it almost immediately.
