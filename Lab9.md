6. Project Status: This week was mostly getting a pdf reader and parser working in pdf.js. Future plans include improving the pdf and text readers, along with the viusal appeal of the project. After the basics are working, we will look into other file formats to potentially add more compatibility with various other file types. One thing I am currently, personally, looking into is trying to keep the popup open even after it is not the focus so search results stay visible for a while longer.
